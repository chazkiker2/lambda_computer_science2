# CS42 - 2.1 - Object Oriented Programming & Graphs

## Overview

During this sprint, we will introduce you to some basics regarding object-oriented programming. Also, we will introduce you to the graph data structure.

## Object-oriented Programming I

This module will teach about the four pillars of object-oriented programming, creating high-level plans for class architecture, classes vs. class instances, defining classes in Python, private methods, variable scope, and class methods and class variables.

## Object-oriented Programming II

In this module, you will learn about inheritance, method overriding, super, and association.

## Graphs III

This module will teach about randomness, pseudo-randomness, and how to shuffle an array in linear time and space complexity.

## Graphs IV

This module will teach about connected componentsâ€“their uses and how to implement an algorithm for finding them.
